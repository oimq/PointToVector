# PointToVector

This Project is for PCD Point to Vector.<br>
<br>
 @ currect progress : get edge from raws and plot to tk<br>
<br>
 @ code intro<br>
draw_map : drawing maps by using tk<br>
Cvec : main algorithm codes for optimizing raw points<br>
PtrToVec : main codes which are producing vector (now just points) from raw points<br>
<br>
 @ how to use<br>
run PtrToVec -> type file name -> see what is different!<br>
<br>
 @ example <br>
Enter the file name : 0.3M_voxel.pcd<br>
