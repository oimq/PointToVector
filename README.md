# PointToVector

This Project is for PCD Point to Vector.

currect progress : get edge and plot to tk

 - code intro
draw_map : drawing maps by using tk
Cvec : main algorithm codes for optimizing raw points
PtrToVec : main codes which are producing vector (now just points) from raw points

 - how to use
run PtrToVec -> type file name -> see what is different!

 - example 
Enter the file name : 0.3M_voxel.pcd
